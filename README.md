### Project Description
CocoWhere is a hilariously unreliable coconut locator game. It pretends to help you find tender coconuts in your city, but in reality, it just lets you place coconuts on a map, click them to view their status, and occasionally roast you for bad coconut etiquette. It also includes a pointless-yet-satisfying CocoBreak coconut smashing mini-game.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People everywhere are plagued by a universal issue ‚Äî not knowing the exact GPS location of the nearest tender coconut. This has led to countless wasted seconds, minor thirst, coconut rage, and occasional existential dread.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
CocoWhere lets users mark coconuts on a map like they‚Äôre priceless treasures, click coconuts to check their ‚Äústatus,‚Äù and get lightly roasted if they bend the coconut rules. When curiosity (or frustration) peaks, users can enter CocoBreak ‚Äî a mini-game where they click a coconut until it explodes , achieving nothing except questionable satisfaction.
